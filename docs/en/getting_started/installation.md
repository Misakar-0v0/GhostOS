# Installation

> GhostOS is still an experimental AI project, and it is strongly recommended to install it in a container like Docker
> rather than executing it locally.

## PIP install

```bash
pip install ghostos
```

Initialize the `workspace` (default `app`), all runtime files of the current version will be stored in the directory.

```bash
ghostos init
```

Configure the Large Language Model. By default, use OpenAI's `gpt-4o`, requiring the environment
variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to exist.
Alternatively, run the `streamlit` editing interface:

```bash
ghostos config
```

Test the default agent:

```bash
# run an agent with python filename or modulename
ghostos web ghostos.demo.agents.jojo
```

Or turn a local Python file into an Agent that can be instructed to call functions or methods within the file through
natural language dialogue.

```bash
ghostos web [my_path_file_path]
```

## Workspace

`GhostOS` is currently using local files to store runtime data, so it's necessary to initialize a workspace.

Running `ghostos init` can be scripted to copy the workspace to the current directory.

Data generated by `GhostOS` during operation will be stored in this directory. When you need to clear historical data,
please execute:

```bash
ghostos clear-runtime
```

## Env

`GhostOS` relies on various model `access tokens`, which are read from environment variables by default.

There are two ways to define these environment variables:

Using a `.env` file (automatically read through `dotenv`)

```bash

copy [workspace]/.example.env [workspace]/.env
vim [workspace]/.env
```
