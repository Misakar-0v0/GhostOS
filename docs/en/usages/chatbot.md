# ChatBot

A conversational robot implemented based on LLM is a baseline testing object during the development of `GhostOS` due to
its simplicity.
It is the simplest implementation of [Ghost](/en/usages/ghost.md).

To create your own conversational robot, you can refer to the file
[ghostos/demo/agents/jojo.py](https://github.com/ghost-in-moss/GhostOS/tree/main/libs/ghostos/ghostos/demo/agents/jojo.py).

```python
from ghostos.ghosts.chatbot import Chatbot

# the __ghost__ magic attr define a ghost instance
# so the script `ghostos web` or `ghostos console` can detect it 
# and run agent application with this ghost.
__ghost__ = Chatbot(
    name="jojo",
    description="a chatbot for baseline test",
    persona="you are an LLM-driven cute girl, named jojo",
    instruction="remember talk to user with user's language."
)
```

To define your own chatbot, simply create a similar Python file and run the `ghostos web` command to invoke it.

The interface generated by Streamlit can be directly modified by the `settings` option to change Ghost's configuration.
The changes will be saved to a local file `.ghosts.yml`, so when `ghostos web` starts, it will prioritize reading the
configuration in `.ghosts.yml`.

The meta-agent for generating chatbots through dialogue is currently in testing, and will be released in the next few
versions.

The core Agent design of `GhostOS` is fully code-interactive [MossAgent](/en/usages/moss_agent.md), see the
documentation for
details.
