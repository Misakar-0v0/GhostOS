GhostOS encapsulates the invocation of Large Language Models within its own abstraction.

For more details, see [ghostos/core/llms](https://github.com/ghost-in-moss/GhostOS/tree/main/ghostos/core/llms/abcd.py).

> The encapsulation of related capabilities are not yet test enough.
> More documentation will be enriched when there is time.
