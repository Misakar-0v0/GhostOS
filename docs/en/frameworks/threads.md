# Threads

In order to achieve fully asynchronous Multi-Agent functionality, `GhostOS` needs to manage the context of all Agents
itself.

Therefore, `GhostOS` has implemented an infrastructure similar to
the [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants).

The historical messages generated by Agents are stored and used with the `GoThreadInfo` structure.

Due to limited personal development capacity, please refer to the detailed implementation
at [ghostos.core.runtime.threads](https://github.com/ghost-in-moss/GhostOS/tree/main/ghostos/core/runtime/threads.py).
