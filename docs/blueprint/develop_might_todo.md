## Optimizer

Optimizer that spans the entire chain, include but not limited:
- task
- mindflow
- prompt
- tool
- LLM ?

Support feedback:
- loss
- Pos/Neg (prompt, result) pairs
- (prompt, result, judgement)

### Key features
- Event-Driven stream
- Multi-task orchestration and scheduling mechanism
  - support complex interaction though multi-agent
  - friendly for both distributed and edge environments
  - non-volatile, persistent agent that can recover after a power outage
  - friendly for human-in-the-loop
- full-code driven
  - turning-compete level tool using/editing/creating
  - almost seamless integration with other libraries/tools
  - friendly scheduling/thinking process for model-training
- Meta-thought mechanism
  - enables the easy and rapid development of almost all agent paradigms
- Self-evolving ?
  - Optimizer that spans the entire chain
