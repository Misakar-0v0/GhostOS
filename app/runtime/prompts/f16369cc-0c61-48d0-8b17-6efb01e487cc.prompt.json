of AgentFn\n:return: tuple[result:AgentFnResult | None , ok: bool]\nIf ok is False, means you need to observe the output that you print in the function, and think another round.\nIf ok is True, means you finish the request and return a final result.\n\nThe MOSS will automatically execute the main function you generated with the instance of class Moss, \ntake next step based on the returns. \n\nSo
